## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
An enum is a unique number type that can not be assigned to identifiers and is strongly typed.

## How can you modify an Enum?
Enum is an int by default and can have its base type changed to a variety of options. Those include byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I have not yet used an Enum. I guess I could use it for making data smaller? From what I read I believe that you can use dot notation in a class to end up digging in to an objects properties but I thought you could do that anyways?
