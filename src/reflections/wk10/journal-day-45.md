## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value, reference and pointer. They are all different ways for CS to allocate the appropriate memory types needed for storage.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Value types are most of the data types that we have in JS minus dictionaries and strings but for some reason does include arrays? The big difference I notice is the strongly typed notations. You can declare a number in so many different ways all based off how much memory our program needs to actually store every piece of data.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types only hold an actual reference to the data and don't actually store the properties data until that data is being retrieved. I think of it as in how JS only refers to instances of classes and models.
