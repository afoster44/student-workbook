## 2. What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding
We knew exactly what data lived within which Object. Before we could link an "user" id to a id in a set of different information directly embedding information of said object to the object would really be the only way to accomplish this. Embedding is still preferred in the one to one method.

## 3. What are some of the challenges we are faced with when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drives your decision on how to create it?
There are so many factors that can ultimately go in to a many-to-many situation. I believe that second guessing which way you want to go could be one of the main factors to a negative outcome.
