## 1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
Query string is how node and the rest of the web enviornments parse through data. It will take the strings and turn it in to the appropriate language needed to structure the data.

## 2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
params will start with a ?property=value. We can actually put multiple params together chained by the & so we could have ?prop=value&property=othervalue...the & symbol will give us our seperation.

## 3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
Query parameters will be strong when we want to target something very specific. I can see them mainly being takin advantage of in put/post/delete methods...we will include them in getters, but most of the logic will be used to change or delete information that already lives on our server.
