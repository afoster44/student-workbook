## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It is a great place to showcase your Applications. You could put 3-4 solid Applications you've built to showcase to perspective employees or clients.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Having your portfolio links in multiple places to draw attention to it. As well as having a wide variety of code to show progression as well.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would very much like to present my Full-Stack BugLog as well as our capstone. We will have to spice up KanBan, but after we do that I would like to present that project as well. I want to showcase that not only can I build a good project solo, but I can also build strong projects as a team player as well.
