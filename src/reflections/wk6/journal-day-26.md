## 1. What are props?
Props are binded properties to Javascript statements used to store dynamic information to be passed from one component to the next.

## 2. What are props used for?
Props are used to bind data to a property on a prop object to dynamically pass data from a child component to a parent.
---
## 3. Where can props be used or accessed?
We need to perform data binding that will give us access to an object from one component to the other. I have personally seen this happen when we are taking properties off of an object in a v-for and data binded that information to another object than exporting it.
