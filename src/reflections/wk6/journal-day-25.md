## 1. What is Component based architecture?
Using components aka small individual pieces of the application to build each piece of the application in its own component and using that to restructure how we build out UIs.

## 2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
IDK about all of the other programmers out there but Component based architecture keeps us in one place at any given time...it will allow us to have all of the HTML, styling and javascript all inside of one file. This is a huge benifit because you wouldn't be working on more than one piece at a time...if you are you most definitely have a problem. Also another thing that components brings in is speed...all of the components dynamically change and update themselves and only themselves....we no longer have to worry about the speed of one component updating in front of another...they all work on their own time.

## 3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
The major problem is over-engineering your page. Seems to be that most people will take the idea of having a single component for each and every single piece of your application  and throw a lot of them in to the same component. Also they say that the bigger your application gets the readability of all of these components gets more difficult.
