## 1.)What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Making a attack plan is definitely going to be my best friend. My number one thing I find myself saying is "I don't know where to start...or I don't know" and having a game plan kind of pre written out today was super awesome.

## 2.)How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Besides asking my lovely instructors and TA's :P I like to use W3 first then if I need a deeper explanation I will go over to MDN. Sometimes it gets bad enough and I realize I am very far away from where I actually wanted to be I'll just step away for a couple of minutes.

Honestly that there are going to be so many ways to "learn the hard way", but with careful research, timing and implementation you can build the biggest projects successfully.
