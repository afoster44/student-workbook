## 1.) What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
console.log() or testing functions or methods. we can console log to first know what data we are trying to access...we could then use it to know when and where data is being utilized.

## 2.) Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
This would come from our Elements tab. This tab is incredibly useful in everyway from being able to debug, but actually make changes to the actual styling of the webpage.

## 3.) Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Going to the sources tab and going to the file navigator pane. This will pull up a window that will allow us to directly add to and debug our javascript file in real time.
