## What is Scope ?

Scope is the location in which our variables are accesible. For instance if it was declared globally, or perhaps locally to a function only.

## What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a feature packed in to Javascript that moves a variable or a function to the top of its scope and is initialized as undefined if declared with var. This also comes to happen w/ our two phases of Javascript, our allocation phase and execution phase. 

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Firstly to the best of my knowledge we know almost always use let over var. Var was our way of declaring variables in ES5 before ES6 was released and const and let were introduced. The difference between using let vs const is const we want to declare a constant and have a piece of data that will not change, and let if we know we need to change the data.
