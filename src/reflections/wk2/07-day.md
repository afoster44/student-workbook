## 1.)What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
We have function definitions, function expressions and arrow functions (I believe this to be the correct answer). A function definition could look like...
---
function (){}
---
function expression
---
let myFunc = function (){}
---
arrow function
---
let myFunc = param => {}
---
## 2.)What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
A Parameter is in my own words our placeholder for our argument which in my own words ends up being the value we want to pass in to our function through our parameter. A parameter would go inside of the function definitions parenths function myFunc => () <= {} and our argument is located in our parenths where we call our function.

## 3.)What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
A function that accepts another function as a parameter or returns another function. I actually did not know that the array.prototype.map/filter methods were considered higher order functions. Learning so much every day!
