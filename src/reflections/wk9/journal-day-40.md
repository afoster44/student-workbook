## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We have actually implemented multiple new technologies. We have currently implemented sockets, Firebase and Nodemailer.
## What went well so far?
All three of them actually. Definitely road blocks, but having the basics down and getting the chance to implement more is so much fun.
## What would you do differently? Why?
The only thing I would do differently is have multiple people working on implementing something new instead of just one person.
