# My first week

## This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

At this point I can say I understand a lot of the basics going in to bootstrap and some of the basic/more in-depth styling you can perform with CSS. I learned that I may not be the most creative w/ the actual flow of the website...meaning colors...fonts etc. However I have learned I really like structuring and actually building out websites. I thought I liked painting because you get to see things come to life quickly, but with the basis of coding it happens faster. I know in the long run a lot what we will do won't be all creation, but at this point I enjoy the creation. I will say that one thing I will struggle with is believing in myself. For some reason it is actually my biggest weakness and I think I can say that with confidence. I hope to overcome this and find that my passion fuels my confidence. I let how "ugly" my site was blind me from how well I had performed on some of the core concepts that were being accomplished. All in all I had a great first week and am very excited to start adding in some JavaScript!
