# Foundations of Web Development

**1.** In the terminal, what is the command `cd` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it allows us to get to the correct file path destination..it will also take us to the absolute base.
```

**2.** In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
this is used to make a new file directory
```

**3.** What is the `\<html>\</html>` tag in a document?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
This allows us to actually create an HTML web page
```

**4.** What does `HTML` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
HyperText Markup Language or the "skeleton"
```

**5.** What Does `CSS` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Cascading Styles Sheet or the "skin"
```

**6.** What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:
```css
 h1.main-title {
   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Selector, Property and Value. The selector in the example above is h1.main-title. It allows us to select our element based on id, class etc. The property here would refer to the color or the "style" then the value in this case would be that color or "whatever is assigned to the property!".
```

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
We could do this multiple ways but a <strong> would make this text bold <\strong>
```

**8.** In what tag does the majority of your code belong?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
If in bootstrap we will be using containers and that is where the majority would be. Besides that we could either use a <main> or <body> tag.
```

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I believe that this is a trick question. According to W3 schools we can make two types of list with <ul> unordered list <\ul> or <ol> ordered list <ol> and the third thing but you guys count it out is the <li> tag but that is for list items.
```

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Flex is a property with multiple different ways to be used. One way might be flex: grow; this would actually make that element grow to what ever value you specified. flex can allow us to give fluid movement to an element that can accept the flex property
```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Height, Width, Padding and Margin will all come in to play. This is the default box givin to us. After we define a height and width we will be given that room. Additionally CSS will also add padding and margin on to the height and width specified. 
```
