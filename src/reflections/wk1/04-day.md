## 1.) What is the purpose of wire-framing?

The purpose of wire-framing is to get a general moch of what site you are trying to build. For example...it's like the make up of our skeleton. Wire-framing is the same thing for our code...also could be put as being our basic architecture for our HTML dox

## 2.) What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

I would like to believe you could go as far with this as you wanted to...I would imagine you could really wire-frame your entire website before you even touched any deep styling/positioning as long as you got the basic positioning laid out. If you are like me this really helps break your page down in to bite sized pieces.

I believe that even a site like Figma would be a super high level of wire-framing...in this case this might help if you were making a super high level webpage that has nothing really like it to conceptualize...I would definitely be making a high level wire-frame of that site.

## 3.) Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I feel this question all depends on how you are going about your wire-framing and when. If we already have a site that we can kind of build from in general lay out then I don't feel as much wire-framing is necessary. On the flip side of that I do find it very important to start getting the full skeleton made up first.
