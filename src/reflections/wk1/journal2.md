## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo-Class can be used on elements to do special actions. The literal definition is that they are used to define a special state of an element as described on W3Schools section on Pseudo-Class. I personally think it is going to be awesome to learn how to do some cool hover stuff as well as the anchors...really all of them. A lot of the Pseudo-Classes seem to be able to target specific elements!

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity in my own words is how closely we have tied something to a rule, and how easy or hard it will then be to over ride this rule later. For example if we were to inline style a css rule in to an HTML document, that can never be overwritten anywhere ever...I guess maybe if we hardlined another rule but I haven't messed with that yet...nor should I get in the habbit I would imagine! We can also use this "specificity" rule to our advantage by over riding some rules with other rules, and not having to do an insane amount of work to make all of those changes.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

I could imagine that someone would try and follow in your code (or who knows maybe even future you?!?!) and would potentially not be able to override any pre-written rules if all of them included !important...I feel this would stem from either someone being lazy...or an absolute last chance effort. I would imagine that there are some very slim cases that !important would be used.
