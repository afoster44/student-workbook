## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I think the biggest benifit for my improvement in design based on the basics I have learned from Bootstrap is not only speed, but how clean the structure is. Sometimes I am not great at picking highly descriptive tags all the time. I learned quickly I tackled CSS step by step so I didnt really have issues with my formatting and moving things where I wanted them to be...the biggest issue for me using only CSS w/o Bootstrap is probably trying to keep track of all my classes and choosing when to tie multiple elements to the same classes.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Hands down the Bootstrap website is the absolute go to for syntax and actual structure for building out the webpage. For actual color schematics and whose sites are killing the games I like to go check out Twitch and Amazon...Black and White w/ their purple and black.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Well from personal experience the only reason I would be on a poorly styled site is because I had to...personally I do not like using super clunky looking websites...because if they look clunky they probably are clunky. A well thought out design will attract our user....follow in the footsteps of Bezos...he absolutely stressed the user experience over everything else. He said it was to an extent it became an obsession...
