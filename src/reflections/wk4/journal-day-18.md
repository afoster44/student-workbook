## 1. What is the purpose of Async/Await?
Async/Await were brought in to solve callback hell as well as to help spread the load from one computer to multiple computers. With insane amounts of stream-lining comes mass amounts of complexity as well.

## 2. What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
You have to define the function with the async keyword...I believe you also need a try/catch and we would await a call in our try and catch any kind of error from that call.

## 3. What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
Async/await cleans up our code as well as being able to have the rest of our code wait "in line" as it is supposed to. The though of writing lines of code in javascript that don't actually operate of single thread reading would cause lots of issues mentally I would imagine.
