Representational State Transfer or basic the transfer of data between two different applications.

## 2. What does Stateless mean?
I understood that it is a server that doesn't necessaraly retain information about the last server request. Basically so that every individual call can be interpreted in it's own way with no link to the last call(s)

## 3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
Using nouns is the biggest one biggest it is descriptive...making sure to have a clean way to access data through your API is important and precise. For big apps it is smart to use noun as well as make them plural. For example we could use accounts and accounts because if we have multiple customers or just the customer or the customer/accounts/account
