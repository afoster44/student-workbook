## 1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
Seeing a whole lot of }) in the end of the code as well as seeing functions using other functions and not actually returning anything.

## 2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
Asynchronous means wait till later or not right now. Callbacks are basically saying once you are finished doing one thing do another...IDK honestly the article wasn't super descriptive on exactly what a callback is IMO. As explained by W3Schools a callback function is a function given to another function to be used.

## 3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
Keep your code shallow, and make sure to name things in a proper manor. Keep things simple and keep them seperated. Build them small and bring them together to do something bigger. Make sure you handle every error as it happens...don't let them continue to grow.

FYI I did not do much here...got to spinning my wheels for about 2-3 hours trying to figure out how to hide and unhide something. Got mad and gave up. Did make a server call and a draw to the page...bout it.
