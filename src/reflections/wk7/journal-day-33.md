## 1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I tried my best to implement more code documentation, and to slow down and go even more piece by piece.

## 2. What went well?
Keeping better track of my code and implementing better naming strategies has kept me on track, and it is easier to spot errors in my code.

## 3. What would you do differently?
I wish that I would of pushed myself a little harder on styling, but honestly every time I think about when I had more time to study I don't. I start looking around and my house is a mess. Better go clean!
