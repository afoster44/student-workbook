## Write a reflection
Well here we are at the end of our last week before either we have graduated or not. The feelings are definitely torn between feeling confident and not confident at all. At this point my pregnant wife is due in 8 weeks which I couldn't be more excited about. In turn this also makes our lifes much harder at this point in time, not to mention how stressed out I have been. All I want to do is make sure that I can provide for my family at this point. Somedays it makes me forget about how passionate I truly am about this career change. I gave up everything over 6 months ago to start studying Javascript. I can not wait until the end of next week when I know I am graduating Codeworks on my Birthday xD.
