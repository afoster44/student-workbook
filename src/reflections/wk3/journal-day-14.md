## 1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
It seeks to help so that we don't have to reload/refresh every single time something actually happens to that data on our page.
## 2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

## 3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
I am going to give a dead honest answer of I do not really know how to answer this question.
