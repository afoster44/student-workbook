## 1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
We will commonly use get and set.

## 2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
I was honestly pretty confused at the explanation given but I believe we need to make sure to have a return statement.

## 3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
We can use get and set methods to make error codes for bad inputs or also making things private as well!
