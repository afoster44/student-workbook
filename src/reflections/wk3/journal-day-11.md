## 1. What problem does using exports solve?
Well for me personally this will solve lots of problems once I am effecient. The biggest problem I see this solving is getting lost and having info about my program secret that I want to stay secret.
Also to not have to rewrite code over and over again.

## 2. How does export differ from export default?
When we use export default it lets java script know that there will only be one thing being exported and it will always be the default. If we want to export multiple things from one file we would instead just use export.

## 3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The more structured and architectured we can be as humans the better. Normally things are implemented specifically because something had already happened...wether the outcome was bad or good it is there for a reason. Using the Module System will also help us vaildate our information and keep a good flow on our data.
