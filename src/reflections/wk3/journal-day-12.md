## 1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
The purpose of encapsulation is not only to control what the user has control over and to create multiple layers. Encapsulation also provides us incredible control flow through out our files.
## 2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
It was creating problems where senior developers knew that the underscore was a convention for naming something private. Then someone would come along and not know that function was private but it is the solution to there problem and they use closure to get access to that function then make it public.
## 3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
We would want to construct our class as an object. Objects methods and properties are private to that object.
